#### Project overview
###### 1. Introduction
 - Weather and safety are two important aspects of our daily lives. **Knowing the weather in advance helps us prepare better for activities, ensuring health and safety**. At the same time, timely warnings about natural disasters such as storms, earthquakes, heat waves, floods, and accidents also make an important contribution to protecting the community. Currently, weather information is often provided through television channels, websites, and mobile applications. However, the integration of weather information with safety functions has not been fully exploited. 

 - In addition, after the Covid-19 pandemic until now, health issues are always everyone's priority. People take care about their health more and more, but there are still unpredictable risks that can come to them. **To minimize risks, there needs to be an application that can detect abnormalities in their body, thereby providing timely warnings to the user or sending warnings to family members**. 

 - Moreover, tourism demand is gradually increasing. Therefore, they also need apps that can notify them of the weather situation where they want to go as well as being able to provide a specific itinerary based on each person's unique requirements such as number of people, the destination they want to go to, their budget, ... 

 - The group recognized these needs, so we decided to choose this Topic: **An application that integrates weather, timely accident notifications, health checks along with providing a specific schedule based on each person's requirements**. This application has strong growth potential, especially in the context that more and more users are using smartphones and are interested in protecting health and safety. The team aimed to design a simple application that integrated many things, had a user-friendly interface, and met the user’s pain points, called **“iweather”**.
